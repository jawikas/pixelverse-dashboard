## Configuration

### Proxy Management

The proxy management system is designed to fetch, validate, and rotate proxies to avoid rate limiting. You can modify the proxy sources in the `Proxy` class in `proxy.py`.

### Email Generation

The `generate_emails` method in the `Core` class uses the Faker library to generate realistic email addresses. You can customize the email generation logic as needed.

### Core Operations

The `Core` class handles all interactions with the Pixelverse API, including requesting OTPs, verifying OTPs, setting referrals, updating profiles, purchasing pets, selecting pets, and claiming rewards. Ensure that your configuration in the `config.json` file is accurate to avoid issues.
